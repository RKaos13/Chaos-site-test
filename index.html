        <h4>Lavender</h4>
        <p>A melodic death/doom project exploring the deepest, darkest corners of the human mind.</p>
        <p>Currently in the late stages of the writing process, recordings are expected to begin in early 2024 for the first demo concept, Moths</p>
        <p>Most of all, Lavender is a journey into the darkest part of thoughts, feelings, emotions. Who are we at 3am, when the lights go out, when no one is watching. When the masks come off. When there's nobody to pretend to.</p>
        <p>Who is that real self that comes out then - and why? What made us this way? There is no room for falsehoods when you dive into your own mind. The demons are there. They're real. And they're terrifying.</p>
        <h4>Other</h4>
        <p>33 years old with a background in Finance, currently involved in Crypto/Blockchain and the technology behind it</p>
        <p>Session musician for metal bands - rhythm guitar, bass or keyboards. Participating in a couple of other musical projects to be announced soon.</p>
